# dynankdown

Dynankdown is a tool that lets you write and store your
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards in
[Dynalist](https://dynalist.io).

It's not yet working, but when it is it will allow you to
easily set up a cron job or serverless script to periodically
sync your dynalist notes with ankiweb.
